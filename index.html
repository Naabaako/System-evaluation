	<h2> <br> Target Audience </b></h2> 

	<p> I have been asked to design a web-based interface for elementary age children to locate library resources. In order to determine how to develop a website for this target audience, I have reviewed five libraries who target similar clientele.  I have chosen the following library catalogs for review: </p>
	
	<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.somervillepubliclibrary.org/kids">Somerville Public Library</a></li>
	<li> <a href="https://montgomerycountymd.libguides.com/kids">Montgomery County Public Library</a> </li>
	<li> <a href="https://lacountylibrary.org/kids-corner/">Los Angeles Public Library</a></li>
	<li> <a href="http://nolalibrary.org/branch/5/childrens-resource-center-library">New Orleans Public Library</a></li> 
	<li> <a href="http://www.mchenrylibrary.org/index.php/my-library/kids-page">McHenry Public Library</a></li>  
	</ul>
	
	<h2> <br> What are the deliverables? </b> </h2> 

	<p> I will be evaluating the websites based on three of the ten criteria established by <a href=”https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/”>10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</a> by Jakob Nielsen. The first criterion focuses on whether the websites have created an interface that is aesthetic and minimalist in design so there is no information that is irrelevant or rarely used. The second criterion is if the design of the website tries to prevent common errors and gives the user a ‘confirmation option’ if they do commit an error before they proceed. Considering that a significant percent of subject searches is due to misspellings, and that children are our target audience, a ‘prevention’ and ‘confirmation’ option is especially important. The last criterion will focus on whether the website has clear error messages for users, explains the problem, and gives suggestions for how to fix the problem. Each website will be evaluated on these deliverables.</p>
	<p> In order to be consistent, I will do a search for Harry Potter, the popular books series, but I will spell the name wrong to see if I am prompted to change my spelling mistake. I will then see if I proceed with my spelling mistake, if the catalog gives me a constructive suggestion for how to locate the misspelled series. </p>

	<h2> <br> Somerville Public Library </b> </h2> 

	<p>The Somerville Public Library is in Somerville, MA. According to the library, “all branches of the Somerville Public Library offer materials, programs, and services to meet the educational and recreational needs of children from birth through sixth grade and the adults who raise, educate, and care for them.” </p>

	<h4> <u> Aesthetic and Minimalist Design </u> </h4> 

	<p>The Somerville Public Library page for kids does not have a particularly busy design, but it has a lot of information that is unrelated to locating library resources. In fact, there is no search option on this page for users to search the library’s catalogs on the kids’ page. As a result, users must go back to the homepage to do a search. </p> 

	<h4> <u> Error Prevention </u> </h4> 
	
	<p>I went back to the homepage to do a search for Harry Potter, but I spelled Harry with only one R. The search did not prompt me to check for my spelling mistake. When I did a search for Harry Potter with only on R, the search yielded only one result, <i>101 amazing Harry Potter facts: unofficial & unauthorised.</i></p> 


	<h4> <u> Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors </u> </h4>
	
	<p>Even though my search retrieved only one record, the system did make suggestions after my search; it suggested that I look up Harry Potter films or J.K. Rowling. It did not suggest I look for Harry Potter books.</p> 

	<h2> <br> Montgomery County Public Library </b> </h2> 

	<p>The Montgomery County Public Library’s page is information for kids from Kindergarten-5th grade.</p>

	<h4> <u> Aesthetic and Minimalist Design </u> </h4>

	<p>There is a lot of information on this webpage – such as information about events for kids and a poll about Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman – so it does not have a minimalist design. The website does have an easily located search box on the righthand side.</p>

	<h4> <u> Error Prevention </u> </h4>

	<p> While there was an easily located search box, the search box was not for searching the catalog, but to search the guide. The search box is misleading, so it is bound to cause a lot of problems for users who are trying to do searches for library resources.</p> 
	
	<h4> <u> Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors </u> </h4>

	<p> When I did the “Search the Guide” instead of a search of the library’s catalog, it did not direct me to the library’s catalog. And when I did a search for the misspelled Harry Potter series, it did prompt me to make a correction.</p>

	<h2> <br> Los Angeles Public Library </b> </h2> 

 	<p>Los Angeles Public Library’s Kids Corner is aimed at both teens and kids.</p>

	<h4> <u> Aesthetic and Minimalist Design </u> </h4>

	<p>The Los Angeles Public Library’s does a good job of meeting Jakob Nielsen’s principle of aesthetic and minimalist design. The website is designed so that one of the very first things a user notices is the search bar.</p>

	<h4> <u> Error Prevention </u> </h4>

	<p> Unlike other websites, when a user clicks on the search bar, it gives the user the option of searching either the library catalog or website, minimizing any user confusion. However, when I looked for Harry Potter with only one R, it did not prompt me to spell it correctly. As a result, my mistake did not yield any matches.</p>

	<h4> <u> Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors </u> </h4>

	<p>After my spelling mistake, the retrieval system did not make any constructive suggestions. The first result I retrieved was for “Harwood, Nora Jane,” a fictitious character.</p>	

	<h2> <br> New Orleans Public Library </b> </h2> 

	<p>The Children's Resource Center Library is home to a vast collection of juvenile and young adult materials as well as a small collection of adult items and hosts many programs for children, teens, and adults.</p>

	<h4> <u> Aesthetic and Minimalist Design </u> </h4>

	<p>The New Orleans Public Library’ s Children's Resource Center Library is the website that seems to most closely hue to Jakob Nielsen’s dictum that websites should not be cluttered with irrelevant information because it diminishes the visibility of relevant information. As a result, the search box, which is centered on the page, is easily located.</p>

	<h4> <u> Error Prevention </u> </h4> 

	<p>The search was not created to prevent errors like spelling mistakes. When I typed in Harry Potter without the R, it did not try to correct my mistake.</p>

	<h4> <u> Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors </u> </h4>

  	<p>After I typed in my Hary Potter with my spelling mistake, I did not find any title results. But the error message I received asked: “Did you mean Harry Potter?” I was also prompted to “try a different kind of search.” I was prompted to: 

	<ul>
	<li>Do a browse search by title, typing just the first few letters of the title.</li>
	<li>Do a browse search by author, typing just the first few letters of the author's last name.</li>
	<li>Do a browse search by subject. Cross-references may help you find related subjects. </li>
	</ul></p>
 
	<h2><br> McHenry Public Library </b></h2>

	<p>McHenry Public Library’s Kids’ Corner does not specify the target age of their audience.</p>

	<h4> <u> Aesthetic and Minimalist Design </u> </h4>

	<p>While the McHenry Public Library is not cluttered with an abundance of irrelevant information, it  has a coloring page that competes with the search box.</p> 

	<h4> <u> Error Prevention </u> </h4> 

	<p>The catalog search does try to anticipate what users might be searching for with autofill but it did not anticipate that I was searching for Harry Potter.</p> 

	<h4> <u> Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors </u> </h4>

	<p>The search for Hary Potter yielded the message, “No titles found (0 hits),” but it did have a message that said “Include related words (11 more titles).” Once I clicked on this link, it directed me to relevant search results for Harry Potter. </p>
